<p><span class=GramE><b>Jim, thank you for taking the time to talk about
software security programs.</b></span><b> This is one topic that I think is
incredibly important, which still doesn't get enough attention in the industry.
You've been promoting software security programs for a long time. How did you
'get it'? What happened that enabled you to understand the importance of having
a software security process?</b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>Jim <span class=SpellE>Routh</span>: My first
role in information security over a decade ago was as a CISO for American
Express. And I was fortunate to have worked with Michael Barrett (<a
href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/magazineContent/Interview-PayPal-CISO-Michael-Barrett">former
CISO for PayPal</a>) and Mark <span class=SpellE>Merkow</span> (software
security lead for Charles Schwab brokerage services), who told me that the
software security program needed a lot of attention, because it was based on a
single review process at the end of the life cycle that did little to teach
software developers how to adjust their practices to reduce defects. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>At the time, most new development was Web applications. I realized that the
attack surface was getting larger, and I wanted to avoid security incidents --
this was back in the day when avoiding incidents was even plausible -- so I
embarked on educating application developers on secure coding practices.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>I think I learned a lot more than they did. The developers and their project
leads viewed security controls in the development process as obstacles to
getting real work accomplished, and they had no budget for the hours of
remediation work required when security vulnerabilities were discovered. My
implementation approach was effective at giving me an education but not that
effective at educating them.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Mark subsequently figured out how to give them the education they needed
after I left and went to The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation. At
DTCC, I realized how vital it was to improve software resiliency to avoid
business disruptions and breaches, which could potentially cause a lack of
confidence in the financial markets globally. I adjusted my approach and
obtained top-down support from the CEO to the CIO to implement a comprehensive
software security program based on the simple premise that producing software
with fewer defects costs less money to support, and discovering flaws earlier
in the life cycle takes less time to fix. I also compared the practices
implemented with a body of knowledge that emerged called the <a
href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Software-Insecurity-BSIMM-V-does-a-number-on-secure-software-dev">Building
Security <span class=GramE>In</span> Maturity Model</a> or BSIMM. It enabled me
to compare the maturity of the controls implemented with those of eight other
companies, like Microsoft, that invested in software security programs.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>That experience helped me understand how to gain support for the program
based on the economic benefits while investing in developer education. I was
able to measure the decrease in vulnerability density, when developers used static
analysis tools in the development process and learned how to avoid defects. I
learned that security vulnerabilities discovered in the development process are
nothing more or less than defects that need to be prioritized and fixed.
Integrating security defects with functional flaws and identifying the
high-risk defects made it easier for the development teams to assign
responsibility for fixing them.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>I still use the economic benefits to convince organizations to implement a
mature software security program, and I've learned that application developers
today embrace the idea of discovering defects early and improving the
resiliency of software. At JPMorgan Chase, I taught software security controls
to more than 17,000 developers globally. They were very receptive to learning
more effective ways to develop systems. I set up a model in which selected
developers got extensive education on software security and they would help
other developers apply the techniques to reduce defects. At <st1:place w:st="on">Aetna</st1:place>
we call them <i>security mavens</i>, and they enforce the key controls.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p><b>Can you tell us a bit about how you do software development at <st1:place
w:st="on">Aetna</st1:place>?</b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Routh</span>: Software development has evolved to where
most custom application development starts with the consumption of open source,
so I've added a control to enforce the use of selected open source frameworks
based on the security risk of the libraries from scan results. I also have some
new cool technologies for mobile applications that deal with the unique
security risks in the mobile application distribution system.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p><b>There are always objections to a software security program. I am sure you
know them, chapter and verse: We can't slow things down. We can't be
constrained. How do you overcome those objections?</b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><figure>The developers don't push back today but project
managers still do until they understand the benefits. <strong></figure><figcaption>James
<span class=SpellE>Routh<span style='font-weight:normal'>Aetna</span></span></strong>
CISO <o:p></o:p></p>

</figcaption>

<p><span class=SpellE>Routh</span>: It's really hard to argue against a process
that saves money, improves quality and reduces risk. I come armed with simple
information demonstrating each attribute and a commitment, which is that having
done this so often it is relatively easy to address. The developers don't push
back today but project managers still do, until they understand the benefits.
Many of the tools I use today for mobile applications are not well known, so I
typically get push-back from mobile developers who are unfamiliar with them. In
those cases, I simply use the industry data available to show how easy it is to
compromise a mobile application and release it through secondary channels. Most
of the vulnerabilities exploited today are the result of breaks in mobile
software distribution.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The bottom line is that selling a software security program is
straightforward when you use the financial benefits as the driver. Implementing
a successful program is more about changing behavior than implementing
technology, so positioning security as an attribute of software quality
reaffirms the role of the development lead -- which is to own the process and
the results -- while security designs the controls and measures effectiveness
primarily for the benefit of the development lead.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p><b>One thing that jumps out at me is that you're leveraging metrics. You're
not just saying, 'This is the right thing to do.' You're able to explain how it
saves money to avoid losses and out-of-cycle maintenance. Can you tell us a bit
about your metrics?</b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Routh</span>: There are two fundamental drivers of
productivity improvement once security controls are implemented into the
development process: First, frameworks like the Enterprise Security API and
tools for open source component selection and static analysis prevent defects
from getting into the build process, so this eliminates the cost of fixing
flaws and defects. Second, detecting defects in quality assurance, and then
fixing the high-priority defects, costs less in terms of time and, therefore,
money compared to fixing defects discovered in production.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>So I calculate the average time it takes to fix a defect post-production
(highly complex defect fix = 8 hours; moderate complexity = 4 hours; simple fix
= 2 hours) and compare it to the average time it takes to fix a defect in
development, and then multiply this by the number of high-risk defects
discovered. I use the standard recovery amount per hour, for example $125, as
the cost -- this is an average industry hourly cost of FTE developers along
with vendors and third-party consultants doing development. The result is a
'productivity save' for all defects prevented, in addition to the savings of
moving defect fixing from post-production to quality assurance or
pre-production. The productivity <span class=GramE>save</span> for development
time is reinvested in more functionality in less time with the removal or
reduction of the defect-fixing work effort.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p><b>What I don't understand is why so few executives seem to 'get it' like
you do. Do you have any idea what we can do to broaden the understanding of
this topic? I feel like with the last 15 years of 'penetrate and patch' -- and
the painful examples of major software vendors constantly pushing bug-fixes --
if that's not a danger sign, what is? What can we do?</b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Routh</span>: More than 70 companies measure the maturity
of their software security programs today in the BSIMM data, so the body of
knowledge in software security has grown significantly. Your question about why
so few leaders get it is a reasonable one, but my point is that many do
understand the economic drivers for software security and have implemented more
effective controls across industries. We know a lot more about software
security practices today than we did a decade ago, and the information that
I've shared with you is available in the public domain.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Many of the software vendors that push bug-fixes also have mature software
security programs established -- Microsoft, Adobe Systems and EMC, to name a
few. The reality is perfection and software are two words that don't belong in
the same sentence, and there will always be opportunities to identify and
improve software defects.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>We are trying something new by taking a Web application that we've applied
all of our controls to and essentially crowd-sourcing the <a
href="http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/penetration-testing">pen
testing</a> of the app to see what we learn. This means that dozens of software
researchers will perform pen tests and share their results with us.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>I fully expect to find new defects from this process despite the dozens of
tests performed on the same software version previously. It also is likely to
help me understand how the many controls deployed in our development process
are performing and where there are opportunities for improvement. We track
defect density over time, and the data clearly shows a dramatic improvement
from the developers who are using better tools to detect defects in
development.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>For as long as we build software there will be defects discovered throughout
the process and opportunities to improve quality. What is clear is that making
investments in improving quality makes good economic sense, and perfection in
software will remain elusive for the near future.<o:p></o:p></p>
